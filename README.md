# Enhanced-Recognition-A-Vision-Transformer-Approach-for-Digits
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic task computers handle well—but what if it could be faster and more efficient, especially on low-power devices? In our recent study, we tackled this by combining Vision Transformers (ViTs) with Few-Shot Learning to create a lightweight, accurate, and super-fast model.
